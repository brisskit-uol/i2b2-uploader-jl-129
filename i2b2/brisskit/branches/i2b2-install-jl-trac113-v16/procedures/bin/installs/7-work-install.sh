#
# Install script for i2b2 Workplace Framework cell
#
# Mandatory: the I2B2_INSTALL_HOME environment variable to be set.
# Optional : the I2B2_INSTALL_WORKSPACE environment variable.
# The latter is an optional full path to a workspace area. If not set, defaults to a workspace
# within the install home.
#
# USAGE: 7-work-install.sh job-name
# Where: 
#   job-name is a suitable tag to group all jobs associated with the overall workflow
# Notes:
#   The job-name is used to locate a work directory for the overall workflow; eg:
#   I2B2_INSTALL_HOME/job-name
#   This work directory must already exist.
#
# Further tailoring can be achieved via the defaults.sh script.
#
# Stops and starts JBoss.
