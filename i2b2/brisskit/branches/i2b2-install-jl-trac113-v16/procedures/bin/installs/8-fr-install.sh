#
# Install script for i2b2 File Repository cell
#
# Mandatory: the I2B2_INSTALL_HOME environment variable to be set.
# Optional : the I2B2_INSTALL_WORKSPACE environment variable.
# The latter is an optional full path to a workspace area. If not set, defaults to a workspace
# within the install home.
#
# USAGE: 8-fr-install.sh job-name
# Where: 
#   job-name is a suitable tag to group all jobs associated with the overall workflow
# Notes:
#   The job-name is used to locate a work directory for the overall workflow; eg:
#   I2B2_INSTALL_HOME/job-name
#   This work directory must already exist.
#
# Further tailoring can be achieved via the defaults.sh script.
#
# NOTES. Jeff: There are some aspects of this I still don't understand
# (1) The REPO_LOCATION needs to be assigned in some way so the system can find it.
#     I think this accomplished via the web client. At least the documentation 
#     might lead you to believe so. See the FRC installation guide...
#     a) Logon to Project Manager Web Interface, select ‘Hive’ and highlight FR Cell 
#     b) Then it states 
#        "Enter the parameters by selecting the row that has the ‘FRC’ as the ID.
#         PathSeparator is the default path separator for the host machine running the cell,
#         on Mac OS and Linux is it /, while on Windows it is \
#         DestDir is the destination where the files will be hosted."
#     There is more related to admin users and SFTP, which please see.
#
#     It would be far better if this were also available via script rather 
#     than a gui interface. This may yet be possible. Requires further investigation.
#
# (2) Stops and starts JBoss.
