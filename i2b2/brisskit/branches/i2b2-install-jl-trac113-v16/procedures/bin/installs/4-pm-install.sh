#
# Install script for i2b2 PM cell
#
# Mandatory: the I2B2_INSTALL_HOME environment variable to be set.
# Optional : the I2B2_INSTALL_WORKSPACE environment variable.
# The latter is an optional full path to a workspace area. If not set, defaults to a workspace
# within the install home.
#
# USAGE: 4-pm-install.sh job-name
# Where: 
#   job-name is a suitable tag to group all jobs associated with the overall workflow
# Notes:
#   The job-name is used to locate a work directory for the overall workflow; eg:
#   I2B2_INSTALL_HOME/work/job-name
#   This work directory must already exist.
#
# Further tailoring can be achieved via the defaults.sh script.
#
# NOTES:
# (1) The PM cell must be the first cell to be deployed...
#     This procedure takes advantage of that to do some prerequisites for all of i2b2,
#     viz: deploying the common package and the web client.
#
# (2) The web client is dependent on an http server running. This install assumes
#     it will be Apache and copies the web client admin source into /var/www/html
#     or similar as defined in the defaults.sh configuration settings.
#     This copy is done after the PM deploy. The http server should be running prior
#     to starting JBoss, so sensibly before this install is started.
#
# (3) Stops and starts JBoss.
